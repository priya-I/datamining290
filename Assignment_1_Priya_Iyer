My Data Set: Film Locations in San Francisco
Link: https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am

Q. 1 What are the types of data available to you? 
As I browsed through many interesting websites containing data sets, I came across mainly two types of data, as Jim mentioned in 
class the last time:
1. Structured data
2. Unstructured data
Some of the structured datasets were the ones that had clearly defined columns and could be easily exported to a relational 
database. 
I have used one of them in this assignment.
Specific examples: 
Geospatial data about worldwide earthquakes in the past 7 days: 
https://explore.data.gov/Geography-and-Environment/Worldwide-M1-Earthquakes-Past-7-Days/7tag-iwnu
Film locations in SF : https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am

Some of the unstructured datasets were the ones drawn out of surveys and questionnaires. They 	did not have a clear description 
of the data they contained. One has to map them out to the relevant questions in the survey and then analyze the responses. Most 
of these data sets are available on Pew Research Center's website 
(http://pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/Data-Tools/Download-Data/Data-Sets.aspx).	

Q. 2 For data sets: how many records are in the data set? 
My dataset is about the locations in San Francisco where certain movies were shot. There are 890 records in the dataset.

Q. 3 For API: what are the limits on fetching data? 
- Not applicable since I am not using an API

Q. 4 Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is interesting 
I don't have a specific record to point to because the data set as a whole is interesting because there are several locations 
where multiple movies have been shot. I think it would be interesting to visualize this dataset on an SF map with a legend movie 
names on the right. Clicking on any of the movies would highlight/circle a spot on the map. It will also help us plot all the 
movie shooting locations on the map and help us visualize the most popular shooting locations for movies.

Q. 5 What are 3 questions you could answer using your data? 
1. Which is the most popular location in SF for movie shootings?
2. Which production company has shot the most number of scenes in SF?
3. Which is the year when most number of scenes had been shot in SF?
